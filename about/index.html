        About me
    </h1>
    <p>
        I love code, that text can create something more than just books is amazing. My programming bit got flipped during my Physics degree in 2015 using Fortran, I've since gone on to learn Python and C. Now this website is my first foray into html &amp; css.

        Stagnation is terrible, and I strive to stay curious - from hobbies like rollerblading and bass guitar, to the media of podcasts and music, I love discovering gems to make life more interesting.
